A few simple case designs to protect the battery and components on the 
rear of the EMF badges for 2018!

Note that these have been made from the original DXF files for the PCBs, 
however they have oly been roughly measured for size with calipers. No cases
have yet been tested on a real badge (although a few are on order).
